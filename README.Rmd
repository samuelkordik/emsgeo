# emsgeo

<!-- badges: start -->

emsgeo contains helper functions for working with the geographic/spatial aspect of EMS data. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of emsgeo like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Usage

This package uses data from two sources: GIS shapefiles describing roadways, and EMS CSV files containing ePCR elements. The package was designed around using City of Dallas GIS shapefiles for streets, which can be found [here](https://egis.dallascityhall.com/resources/shapefileDownload.aspx). The EMS CSV files for this package were exported from ImageTrend Elite, but could be sourced from any ePCR with the necessary NEMSIS fields. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#library(emsgeo)

## Set filenames for source data and details
mvcs_filename <- here::here("../data/MVCs_Export.csv")
streets_filename <- here::here("../data/STREETS 2/STREETS.shp")
streets_layer <- "STREETS"
mvc_coords = c("scene_lon", "scene_lat")

## Import data
mvcs <- read_mvc_data(mvcs_filename)
streets <- get_streets(streets_filename, streets_layer)
incidents_sf <- incidents_as_sf(mvcs, coords = mvc_coords)

## Complete merge
merged <- merge_mvcs_streets(incidents_sf,
                             streets)


## Save out
write_csv(as.data.frame(merged),
          here::here("../data/merged.csv"),
          append = FALSE)
```
